# single-photon-camera

Repo includes data and code presented in <br />
"Photon-efficient imaging with a single-photon camera" by <br />
D.Shin, F.Xu, D.Venkatraman, R.Lussana, F.Villa, F.Zappa, V.K.Goyal, F.N.C.Wong, and J.H.Shapiro

The computational imaging framework uses variants of 
SPIRAL-TAP software by Harmany et al.
(http://drz.ac/code/spiraltap/)
and 
OMP implementation by Becker
(http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/32402-cosamp-and-omp-for-sparse-recovery)
